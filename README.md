# PyTorch
*List of templates focused on PyTorch deep learning framework.* This repository contatins code template aiming to exaplain how PyTorch works not how to implement a specific model! If you are looking for a specific tutorial on CV, NLP or others, please look one folder upstream this one.

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.
