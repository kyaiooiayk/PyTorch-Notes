# PyTorch
*List of templates focused on PyTorch deep learning framework.* This repository contatins code template aiming to exaplain how PyTorch works not how to implement a specific model! If you are looking for a specific tutorial on CV, NLP or others, please look one folder upstream this one.

## PyTorch Lightning
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) makes creating PyTorch models easier. At the moment writing even a simple PyTorch model means writing a lot of code and that is the price you have to pay for its flexibility. 
- If a boiler plate code does nothing more than the default training process then it can be abstraced away. In Lightning, these elements are automated as much as possible.
- PyTorch Lightning is built on top of ordinary (vanilla) PyTorch. The purpose of Lightning is to provide a research framework that allows for fast experimentation and scalability, which it achieves via an OOP approach that removes boilerplate and hardware-reference code.

## A note on the notebook rendering
Each notebook has two versions (all python scripts are unaffected by this):
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in black& white. These are placed in the folder named `GitHub_MD_rendering` where MD stands for MarkDown.
- One where all the markdown comments are rendered in coloured.
